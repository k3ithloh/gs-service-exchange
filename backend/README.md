If need to drop db:
sh
DROP DATABASE <database name>;


## Deployment Pipeline 🏁
(Let's see if we can automate this)

Run the following commands in the project directory (---/backend) to package our code for deployment.
 sh
dotnet publish -c Release -o deploy
cd deploy
zip -r ../deploy_bundle.zip *

Go to Elastic Beanstalk in the AWS Management Console. On the left navbar and click on the following:
Environments > rainbow-unicorn-api-prod-env > Upload and deploy > Choose File > Select the deploy_bundle.zip you just created.

Version label will be automatically generated, no need to change. Then click Deploy.

Deployment takes around 1-3 mins. After deployment is completed, ensure that Health Status is Ok. You may click the Go to Environment on the left navbar to access the landing page of our api.

If eb-cli is set up in your dir: 
 sh
dotnet publish -c Release -o deploy
cd deploy
zip -r ../deploy_bundle.zip *
eb deploy --staged  # deploy with one line! 🙂


## Database commands for CLI
List DB `\l`  
Connect to a DB \c testdb;  
List all tables in the connect DB \dt
Show all rows in a table SELECT * FROM "<table_name>";  
Drop rows in a table DELETE FROM "<table_name>";  
Terminate other connections SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pg_stat_activity.pid)
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE pg_stat_activity.datname = 'TARGET_DB' -- ← change this to your DB
AND pid <> pg_backend_pid();
